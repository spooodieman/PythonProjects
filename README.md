# Python Projects

A collection of small Python projects I’ve made for fun and learning.  
Each project is self-contained and focuses on a specific concept or skill.

## Projects

1. **Battleship (CLI)** – Classic battleship game playable in the terminal.  
2. **Hangman (CLI)** – Word-guessing game with ASCII visuals.  
3. **Unit Converter (GUI)** – Tkinter app for converting between units of measurement.

## How to Run

Clone the repository and run any project:

```bash
# Clone using HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/spooodieman/PythonProjects.git

# Or clone using SSH
git clone git@github.com:spooodieman/PythonProjects.git

cd PythonProjects/<App-Name>
python main.py
